# Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine

Artificial Intelligence in personalized medicine holds great promise, particularly with tools like genomic profiling to tailor treatments. However, bias and fairness must be top priorities.

For instance, if an AI system is trained primarily on genomic data from North American populations (common in datasets like TCGA), it may not generalize well to underrepresented ethnic groups in Africa or Asia. This can lead to inaccurate treatment recommendations, misdiagnoses, or disparities in healthcare outcomes.

## Sources of Bias

- Underrepresentation of minorities in training data.
- Lack of contextual healthcare information (e.g., access to care, lifestyle).
- Inherited human biases in labeled data.

## Fairness Strategies

1. **Diverse Training Data**: Incorporate genomic data from different ethnicities and demographics.
2. **Algorithm Audits**: Regularly audit AI models for disparate impact across groups.
3. **Explainability**: Use models that allow doctors to understand why a recommendation was made.
4. **Transparency**: Publish model limitations and data coverage openly.

By applying these strategies, AI in personalized medicine can become equitable, supporting truly inclusive healthcare innovations.
