# Case Study Critique: AI in Smart Cities

## AI-IoT for Traffic Management

### Improvements for Urban Sustainability

- **Traffic Flow Optimization**:
  - Real-time AI analysis of traffic camera feeds to reduce congestion.
  - Dynamic traffic signals based on sensor input lead to lower emissions.
- **Energy Efficiency**:
  - Smart streetlights use AI to adjust brightness based on pedestrian or vehicle presence.
- **Waste Management**:
  - AI schedules garbage collection based on sensor data from bins.
- **Predictive Maintenance**:
  - Vibration sensors on bridges, coupled with AI, predict structural issues before failures occur.

### Challenges

1. **Data Privacy & Security**:
   - Public cameras and sensors collect vast amounts of personal data, posing risks of misuse or surveillance creep.
   - Networked IoT devices create surfaces for hackers to manipulate traffic systems.
   - License plate recognition cameras could enable mass surveillance if not properly regulated.
2. **Infrastructure & Cost**:
   - Deploying and maintaining large-scale AI-IoT systems requires significant investment.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Models trained for one region may not generalize well to others.
