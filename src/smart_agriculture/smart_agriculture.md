# Task 2: AI-Driven IoT Concept

## Scenario: Design a Smart Agriculture System Using AI and IoT

### A. Sensors Needed

- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Temperature Sensor
- Humidity Sensor
- Light Intensity Sensor
- pH Sensor

### B. AI Model

Use a regression model or LSTM (time series) to predict crop yield.

### C. Data Flow Diagram

```
[Soil/Temp Sensors] --> [IoT Gateway] --> [AI Model Server] --> [Predicted Crop Yield] --> [Farmer Dashboard]
```

### Summary

Using soil, weather, and light data collected via IoT sensors, our AI regression model predicts expected crop yield per plot. This helps farmers make data-driven irrigation and fertilizer decisions, increasing sustainability and efficiency.
